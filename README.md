## Hobbies
When I'm not coding, I'm planning my next convention and cosplay, playing video games, and playing with my cats, Evie and Khali. I am proud of my multicutural identity, which I often have represented through my sister's art (Multinational Patriot) and am always happy to share food recommendations!
